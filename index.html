			<label for = "first">I just got a notice from the IRS. What should I do?</label>
			<div class ="content1">
				<p>Make sure to read it carefully. Check for what the IRS is asking for. Not all letters from the IRS are for a balance due. Sometimes the IRS has questions or needs to verify certain information. If the IRS is claiming you owe a balance, look for an explanation and required response date and take note of this. If you disagree with an IRS determination, you can mail a letter explaining why. If you’re given a deadline it’s important to respond by that date. If you have questions about your notice and what you should do, give us a call and we’d be happy to explain it to you.</p>

			<div class ="content1">
				<p>We are a full service tax consulting and mediation provider. This means we can handle anything you throw at us. We specialize in back tax resolution with the IRS and state taxing agencies.

			<input type = "radio" name ="accordian" id = "Third">
			<label for = "Third">Who qualifies for a tax relief program?</label>
			<div class ="content1">
				<p>All American taxpayers have rights when it comes to dealing with the IRS. Almost all individuals and small businesses in the US qualify for some type of relief, as long as your tax problems don’t stem from criminal activity or fraud. There are many different programs available with different criteria for each. That’s why we offer a free consultation to assess your issues and then investigate each case individually to create a custom resolution plan that best works for you.</p>

			<label for = "Fourth">How much does it cost?</label>
			<div class ="content1">
				<p>You may have guessed that not everyone’s tax situation is the same. Some are very simple to fix and others will require more time and work. Because of this, prices can vary widely and there’s no way for us to ethically advertise a one size fits all fee. However, during our free consultation we will be able to assess your situation and give you a quote. We will give you all the information you need to know and answer any questions you may have so you can make an informed decision. We do our best to keep our prices fair and reasonable. With our payment plans, many people can get started for as little as $95. We never want anyone to feel they can’t receive professional help, just because they can’t afford it. No matter what your situation is we find a way to work with you to get your tax matters settled.

			<label for = "Fifth">Will a former IRS Agent really represent me?</label>
			<div class ="content1">
				<p>Our team is comprised of many tax professionals including former IRS Revenue Agents and Officers. Former IRS Agents will typically work the more serious and complicated cases. Since we represent small and large cases alike, not every case will be represented by a Former IRS Agent directly. However, all of our professionals are licensed and experienced in IRS tax resolution matters and they all benefit from the experience and knowledge of our all-star EX-IRS team members.

		<li>
			<input type = "radio" name ="accordian" id = "Sixth">
			<label for = "Sixth">What if I haven’t filed tax returns for several years?</label>
			<div class ="content1">
				<p>The first thing you need to know is that just because you didn’t file a tax return doesn’t mean you won’t have a balance due. The IRS can actually file the returns for you at the highest tax rates without any deductions or credit you may have been able to claim. Because of this you could have balances accumulating interests and penalties you don’t even know about. Additionally the IRS will not accept many types of resolution proposals until all delinquent tax returns are filed. Preparing past due tax returns is included in our resolution services so if you’re behind on your taxes we will get you got up.
